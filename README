GObject Introspection

GIR & Typelib formats
=====================
FIXME

Tools
=====

Three tools are shipped with GObject Introspection:
- g-ir-compile, a typelib compiler. It converts one or more GIR files 
  into one or more typelib blobs. It can either emit the raw typelib 
  blob or C code (--code). 
- g-ir-generate, an GIR generator, using the repository API. It generates
  GIR files from binary typelib which can be in a shared object, or a raw
  typelib blob. 
- g-ir-scanner, a tool which generates GIR XML files by parsing headers
  and introspecting GObject based libraries.

API library
===========
There's also a C based library called libgirepository which provides
an API to access to the typelib metadata. It also contains an API to 
invoke functions, given the function info object. The implementation is 
based on libffi (3.0 or higher of libffi required, can be found at 
http://sourceware.org/libffi).

There are a number of GIR test files in tests/, and a script to do
roundtrip tests (GIR -> typelib -> GIR).

Helping out
=========== 
The introspection framework needs a lot more work, see TODO.
