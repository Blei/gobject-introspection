XML format
----------
- Document the format
- Write a scanner to create XML from annotated headers
- Add attributes to connect signals to their default handlers
  and wrappers to their vfuncs
- Add attributes for struct offsets

Binary format
-------------
- Add hashes to lookup interfaces and functions in interfaces
- Do we need (at least limited) handling of unions ? E.g. GdkEvent
- Write a validator

Compiler
--------
- Cleanup, maybe turn the nodes in to objects to avoid the horrific 
  type switches
- Add thorough error checking

Repository
----------
- Reconsider the current clunky API, maybe an iterator approach is better
- Add thorough error checking
- Use hashes 
- Implement g_function_info_invoke()
- Maybe allow populating repositories at runtime
- need a method to access may-be-null for the return type of a function

General
-------
- More tests
- Check how the format scales to something the size of GTK+
