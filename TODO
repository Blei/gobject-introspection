XML format
----------
- Document the format
- Write a tool to create XML from annotated headers
- Add attributes to connect signals to their default handlers
  and wrappers to their vfuncs

Binary format
-------------
- Add hashes to lookup interfaces and functions in interfaces
- Write a validator

Compiler
--------
- Cleanup, maybe turn the nodes in to objects to avoid the horrific 
  type switches
- Add thorough error checking

Repository
----------
- Reconsider the current clunky API, maybe an iterator approach is better
- Add thorough error checking
- Use hashes 
- Implement g_function_info_invoke()
- Maybe allow populating repositories at runtime

General
-------
- More tests
- Check how the format scales to something of GTK+ size
