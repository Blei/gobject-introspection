 */


/**
 * GClassInitFunc:
 * @g_class: The #GTypeClass structure to initialize.
 * @class_data: The @class_data member supplied via the #GTypeInfo structure.
 *
 * A callback function used by the type system to initialize the class
 * of a specific type. This function should initialize all static class
 * members.
 * The initialization process of a class involves:
 * <itemizedlist>
 * <listitem><para>
 * 1 - Copying common members from the parent class over to the
 * derived class structure.
 * </para></listitem>
 * <listitem><para>
 * 2 -  Zero initialization of the remaining members not copied
 * over from the parent class.
 * </para></listitem>
 * <listitem><para>
 * 3 - Invocation of the GBaseInitFunc() initializers of all parent
 * types and the class' type.
 * </para></listitem>
 * <listitem><para>
 * 4 - Invocation of the class' GClassInitFunc() initializer.
 * </para></listitem>
 * </itemizedlist>
 * Since derived classes are partially initialized through a memory copy
 * of the parent class, the general rule is that GBaseInitFunc() and
 * GBaseFinalizeFunc() should take care of necessary reinitialization
 * and release of those class members that were introduced by the type
 * that specified these GBaseInitFunc()/GBaseFinalizeFunc().
 * GClassInitFunc() should only care about initializing static
 * class members, while dynamic class members (such as allocated strings
 * or reference counted resources) are better handled by a GBaseInitFunc()
 * for this type, so proper initialization of the dynamic class members
 * is performed for class initialization of derived types as well.
 * An example may help to correspond the intend of the different class
 * initializers:
 *
 * |[
 * typedef struct {
 * GObjectClass parent_class;
 * gint         static_integer;
 * gchar       *dynamic_string;
 * } TypeAClass;

 * {
 * class->dynamic_string = g_strdup ("some string");
 * }
 * static void
 * type_a_base_class_finalize (TypeAClass *class)
 * {
 * g_free (class->dynamic_string);
 * }
 * static void
 * type_a_class_init (TypeAClass *class)
 * {
 * class->static_integer = 42;
 * }
 *
 * typedef struct {
 * TypeAClass   parent_class;
 * gfloat       static_float;
 * GString     *dynamic_gstring;
 * } TypeBClass;
 * static void
 * type_b_base_class_init (TypeBClass *class)
 * {

 * type_b_class_init (TypeBClass *class)
 * {
 * class->static_float = 3.14159265358979323846;
 * }
 * ]|
 * Initialization of TypeBClass will first cause initialization of
 * TypeAClass (derived classes reference their parent classes, see
 * g_type_class_ref() on this).
 * Initialization of TypeAClass roughly involves zero-initializing its fields,
 * then calling its GBaseInitFunc() type_a_base_class_init() to allocate
 * its dynamic members (dynamic_string), and finally calling its GClassInitFunc()
 * type_a_class_init() to initialize its static members (static_integer).
 * The first step in the initialization process of TypeBClass is then
 * a plain memory copy of the contents of TypeAClass into TypeBClass and
 * zero-initialization of the remaining fields in TypeBClass.
 * The dynamic members of TypeAClass within TypeBClass now need
 * reinitialization which is performed by calling type_a_base_class_init()
 * with an argument of TypeBClass.
 * After that, the GBaseInitFunc() of TypeBClass, type_b_base_class_init()
 * is called to allocate the dynamic members of TypeBClass (dynamic_gstring),
 * and finally the GClassInitFunc() of TypeBClass, type_b_class_init(),
 * is called to complete the initialization process with the static members
 * (static_float).
 * Corresponding finalization counter parts to the GBaseInitFunc() functions
 * have to be provided to release allocated resources at class finalization
 * time.

/**
 * GMutex:
 *
 * The #GMutex struct is an opaque data structure to represent a mutex

 *
 * <example>
 * <title>A function which will not work in a threaded environment</title>
 * <programlisting>
 * int
 * give_me_next_number (void)
 * {
 * static int current_number = 0;
 *
 * /<!-- -->* now do a very complicated calculation to calculate the new
 * * number, this might for example be a random number generator
 * *<!-- -->/
 * current_number = calc_next_number (current_number);
 *
 * return current_number;
 * }
 * </programlisting>
 * </example>
 *
 * It is easy to see that this won't work in a multi-threaded
 * application. There current_number must be protected against shared
 * access. A first naive implementation would be:
 *
 * <example>
 * <title>The wrong way to write a thread-safe function</title>
 * <programlisting>
 * int
 * give_me_next_number (void)
 * {
 * static int current_number = 0;
 * int ret_val;
 * static GMutex * mutex = NULL;
 *
 * if (!mutex) mutex = g_mutex_new (<!-- -->);
 *
 * g_mutex_lock (mutex);
 * ret_val = current_number = calc_next_number (current_number);
 * g_mutex_unlock (mutex);
 *
 * return ret_val;
 * }
 * </programlisting>
 * </example>
 *
 * This looks like it would work, but there is a race condition while
 * constructing the mutex and this code cannot work reliable. Please do
 * not use such constructs in your own programs! One working solution
 * is:
 *
 * <example>
 * <title>A correct thread-safe function</title>
 * <programlisting>
 * static GMutex *give_me_next_number_mutex = NULL;
 *
 * /<!-- -->* this function must be called before any call to
 * * give_me_next_number(<!-- -->)
 * *
 * * it must be called exactly once.
 * *<!-- -->/
 * void
 * init_give_me_next_number (void)
 * {
 * g_assert (give_me_next_number_mutex == NULL);
 * give_me_next_number_mutex = g_mutex_new (<!-- -->);
 * }
 *
 * int
 * give_me_next_number (void)
 * {
 * static int current_number = 0;
 * int ret_val;
 *
 * g_mutex_lock (give_me_next_number_mutex);
 * ret_val = current_number = calc_next_number (current_number);
 * g_mutex_unlock (give_me_next_number_mutex);
 *
 * return ret_val;
 * }
 * </programlisting>
 * </example>
 *
 * #GStaticMutex provides a simpler and safer way of doing this.
 *
 * If you want to use a mutex, and your code should also work without
 * calling g_thread_init() first, then you cannot use a #GMutex, as
 * g_mutex_new() requires that the thread system be initialized. Use a
 * #GStaticMutex instead.
 *
 * A #GMutex should only be accessed via the following functions.
 *
 * <note><para>All of the <function>g_mutex_*</function> functions are
 * actually macros. Apart from taking their addresses, you can however
 * use them as if they were functions.</para></note>

 * @dispose: the @dispose function is supposed to drop all references to other objects, but keep the instance otherwise intact, so that client method invocations still work. It may be run multiple times (due to reference loops). Before returning, @dispose should chain up to the @dispose method of the parent class.
 * @finalize: instance finalization function, should finish the finalization of the instance begun in @dispose and chain up to the @finalize method of the parent class.

 * @constructed: the @constructed function is called by g_object_new() as the final step of the object creation process.  At the point of the call, all construction properties have been set on the object.

 *
 * The #GPrivate struct is an opaque data structure to represent a

 * <function>give_me_next_number(<!-- -->)</function> example from
 * above.  Suppose we don't want <literal>current_number</literal> to be
 * shared between the threads, but instead to be private to each thread.
 * This can be done as follows:
 *
 * <example>
 * <title>Using GPrivate for per-thread data</title>
 * <programlisting>
 * GPrivate* current_number_key = NULL; /<!-- -->* Must be initialized somewhere
 * with g_private_new (g_free); *<!-- -->/

 * give_me_next_number (void)
 * {
 * int *current_number = g_private_get (current_number_key);
 *

 * {
 * current_number = g_new (int, 1);
 * *current_number = 0;
 * g_private_set (current_number_key, current_number);
 * }
 *
 * *current_number = calc_next_number (*current_number);
 *
 * return *current_number;
 * }
 * </programlisting>
 * </example>
 *
 * Here the pointer belonging to the key
 * <literal>current_number_key</literal> is read. If it is %NULL, it has
 * not been set yet. Then get memory for an integer value, assign this
 * memory to the pointer and write the pointer back. Now we have an
 * integer value that is private to the current thread.
 *
 * The #GPrivate struct should only be accessed via the following

/**
 * GRegexCompileFlags:
 * @G_REGEX_CASELESS: Letters in the pattern match both upper- and lowercase letters. This option can be changed within a pattern by a "(?i)" option setting.
 * @G_REGEX_MULTILINE: By default, GRegex treats the strings as consisting of a single line of characters (even if it actually contains newlines). The "start of line" metacharacter ("^") matches only at the start of the string, while the "end of line" metacharacter ("$") matches only at the end of the string, or before a terminating newline (unless #G_REGEX_DOLLAR_ENDONLY is set). When #G_REGEX_MULTILINE is set, the "start of line" and "end of line" constructs match immediately following or immediately before any newline in the string, respectively, as well as at the very start and end. This can be changed within a pattern by a "(?m)" option setting.
 * @G_REGEX_DOTALL: A dot metacharater (".") in the pattern matches all characters, including newlines. Without it, newlines are excluded. This option can be changed within a pattern by a ("?s") option setting.
 * @G_REGEX_EXTENDED: Whitespace data characters in the pattern are totally ignored except when escaped or inside a character class. Whitespace does not include the VT character (code 11). In addition, characters between an unescaped "#" outside a character class and the next newline character, inclusive, are also ignored. This can be changed within a pattern by a "(?x)" option setting.
 * @G_REGEX_ANCHORED: The pattern is forced to be "anchored", that is, it is constrained to match only at the first matching point in the string that is being searched. This effect can also be achieved by appropriate constructs in the pattern itself such as the "^" metacharater.
 * @G_REGEX_DOLLAR_ENDONLY: A dollar metacharacter ("$") in the pattern matches only at the end of the string. Without this option, a dollar also matches immediately before the final character if it is a newline (but not before any other newlines). This option is ignored if #G_REGEX_MULTILINE is set.
 * @G_REGEX_UNGREEDY: Inverts the "greediness" of the quantifiers so that they are not greedy by default, but become greedy if followed by "?". It can also be set by a "(?U)" option setting within the pattern.
 * @G_REGEX_RAW: Usually strings must be valid UTF-8 strings, using this flag they are considered as a raw sequence of bytes. @G_REGEX_NO_AUTO_CAPTURE: Disables the use of numbered capturing parentheses in the pattern. Any opening parenthesis that is not followed by "?" behaves as if it were followed by "?:" but named parentheses can still be used for capturing (and they acquire numbers in the usual way).
 * @G_REGEX_OPTIMIZE: Optimize the regular expression. If the pattern will be used many times, then it may be worth the effort to optimize it to improve the speed of matches.
 * @G_REGEX_DUPNAMES: Names used to identify capturing subpatterns need not be unique. This can be helpful for certain types of pattern when it is known that only one instance of the named subpattern can ever be matched.
 * @G_REGEX_NEWLINE_CR: Usually any newline character is recognized, if this option is set, the only recognized newline character is '\r'.
 * @G_REGEX_NEWLINE_LF: Usually any newline character is recognized, if this option is set, the only recognized newline character is '\n'.
 * @G_REGEX_NEWLINE_CRLF: Usually any newline character is recognized, if this option is set, the only recognized newline character sequence is '\r\n'.

/**
 * GRegexMatchFlags:
 * @G_REGEX_MATCH_ANCHORED: The pattern is forced to be "anchored", that is, it is constrained to match only at the first matching point in the string that is being searched. This effect can also be achieved by appropriate constructs in the pattern itself such as the "^" metacharater.
 * @G_REGEX_MATCH_NOTBOL: Specifies that first character of the string is not the beginning of a line, so the circumflex metacharacter should not match before it. Setting this without #G_REGEX_MULTILINE (at compile time) causes circumflex never to match. This option affects only the behaviour of the circumflex metacharacter, it does not affect "\A".
 * @G_REGEX_MATCH_NOTEOL: Specifies that the end of the subject string is not the end of a line, so the dollar metacharacter should not match it nor (except in multiline mode) a newline immediately before it. Setting this without #G_REGEX_MULTILINE (at compile time) causes dollar never to match. This option affects only the behaviour of the dollar metacharacter, it does not affect "\Z" or "\z".
 * @G_REGEX_MATCH_NOTEMPTY: An empty string is not considered to be a valid match if this option is set. If there are alternatives in the pattern, they are tried. If all the alternatives match the empty string, the entire match fails. For example, if the pattern "a?b?" is applied to a string not beginning with "a" or "b", it matches the empty string at the start of the string. With this flag set, this match is not valid, so GRegex searches further into the string for occurrences of "a" or "b".
 * @G_REGEX_MATCH_PARTIAL: Turns on the partial matching feature, for more documentation on partial matching see g_match_info_is_partial_match().
 * @G_REGEX_MATCH_NEWLINE_CR: Overrides the newline definition set when creating a new #GRegex, setting the '\r' character as line terminator.

 * </example>
 *
 * Sometimes you would like to dynamically create a mutex. If you don't

/**
 * GStaticRWLock:
 *
 * The #GStaticRWLock struct represents a read-write lock. A read-write
 * lock can be used for protecting data that some portions of code only
 * read from, while others also write. In such situations it is
 * desirable that several readers can read at once, whereas of course
 * only one writer may write at a time. Take a look at the following
 * example:
 *
 * <example>
 * <title>An array with access functions</title>
 * <programlisting>
 * GStaticRWLock rwlock = G_STATIC_RW_LOCK_INIT;
 * GPtrArray *array;
 *
 * gpointer
 * my_array_get (guint index)

 * gpointer retval = NULL;
 *
 * if (!array)
 * return NULL;
 *
 * g_static_rw_lock_reader_lock (&amp;rwlock);
 * if (index &lt; array->len)
 * retval = g_ptr_array_index (array, index);
 * g_static_rw_lock_reader_unlock (&amp;rwlock);
 *
 * return retval;
 * }
 *
 * void
 * my_array_set (guint index, gpointer data)

 * g_ptr_array_index (array, index) = data;
 *
 * g_static_rw_lock_writer_unlock (&amp;rwlock);
 * }
 * </programlisting>
 * </example>
 *
 * This example shows an array which can be accessed by many readers
 * (the <function>my_array_get()</function> function) simultaneously,
 * whereas the writers (the <function>my_array_set()</function>
 * function) will only be allowed once at a time and only if no readers
 * currently access the array. This is because of the potentially
 * dangerous resizing of the array. Using these functions is fully
 * multi-thread safe now.
 *
 * Most of the time, writers should have precedence over readers. That
 * means, for this implementation, that as soon as a writer wants to
 * lock the data, no other reader is allowed to lock the data, whereas,
 * of course, the readers that already have locked the data are allowed
 * to finish their operation. As soon as the last reader unlocks the
 * data, the writer will lock it.
 *
 * Even though #GStaticRWLock is not opaque, it should only be used
 * with the following functions.
 *
 * All of the <function>g_static_rw_lock_*</function> functions can be
 * used even if g_thread_init() has not been called. Then they do
 * nothing, apart from <function>g_static_rw_lock_*_trylock</function>,
 * which does nothing but returning %TRUE.
 *
 * <note><para>A read-write lock has a higher overhead than a mutex. For
 * example, both g_static_rw_lock_reader_lock() and
 * g_static_rw_lock_reader_unlock() have to lock and unlock a
 * #GStaticMutex, so it takes at least twice the time to lock and unlock
 * a #GStaticRWLock that it does to lock and unlock a #GStaticMutex. So
 * only data structures that are accessed by multiple readers, and which
 * keep the lock for a considerable time justify a #GStaticRWLock. The
 * above example most probably would fare better with a

/**
 * GTypeValueTable:
 * @value_init: Default initialize @values contents by poking values directly into the value->data array. The data array of the #GValue passed into this function was zero-filled with <function>memset()</function>, so no care has to be taken to free any old contents. E.g. for the implementation of a string value that may never be %NULL, the implementation might look like: |[ value->data[0].v_pointer = g_strdup (""); ]|
 * @value_free: Free any old contents that might be left in the data array of the passed in @value. No resources may remain allocated through the #GValue contents after this function returns. E.g. for our above string type: |[ // only free strings without a specific flag for static storage if (!(value->data[1].v_uint & G_VALUE_NOCOPY_CONTENTS)) g_free (value->data[0].v_pointer); ]|
 * @value_copy: @dest_value is a #GValue with zero-filled data section and @src_value is a properly setup #GValue of same or derived type. The purpose of this function is to copy the contents of @src_value into @dest_value in a way, that even after @src_value has been freed, the contents of @dest_value remain valid. String type example: |[ dest_value->data[0].v_pointer = g_strdup (src_value->data[0].v_pointer); ]|
 * @value_peek_pointer: If the value contents fit into a pointer, such as objects or strings, return this pointer, so the caller can peek at the current contents. To extend on our above string example: |[ return value->data[0].v_pointer; ]|
 * @collect_format: A string format describing how to collect the contents of this value bit-by-bit. Each character in the format represents an argument to be collected, and the characters themselves indicate the type of the argument. Currently supported arguments are: <variablelist> <varlistentry><term /><listitem><para> 'i' - Integers. passed as collect_values[].v_int. </para></listitem></varlistentry> <varlistentry><term /><listitem><para> 'l' - Longs. passed as collect_values[].v_long. </para></listitem></varlistentry> <varlistentry><term /><listitem><para> 'd' - Doubles. passed as collect_values[].v_double. </para></listitem></varlistentry> <varlistentry><term /><listitem><para> 'p' - Pointers. passed as collect_values[].v_pointer. </para></listitem></varlistentry> </variablelist> It should be noted that for variable argument list construction, ANSI C promotes every type smaller than an integer to an int, and floats to doubles. So for collection of short int or char, 'i' needs to be used, and for collection of floats 'd'.
 * @collect_value: The collect_value() function is responsible for converting the values collected from a variable argument list into contents suitable for storage in a GValue. This function should setup @value similar to value_init(); e.g. for a string value that does not allow %NULL pointers, it needs to either spew an error, or do an implicit conversion by storing an empty string. The @value passed in to this function has a zero-filled data array, so just like for value_init() it is guaranteed to not contain any old contents that might need freeing. @n_collect_values is exactly the string length of @collect_format, and @collect_values is an array of unions #GTypeCValue with length @n_collect_values, containing the collected values according to @collect_format. @collect_flags is an argument provided as a hint by the caller. It may contain the flag %G_VALUE_NOCOPY_CONTENTS indicating, that the collected value contents may be considered "static" for the duration of the @value lifetime. Thus an extra copy of the contents stored in @collect_values is not required for assignment to @value. For our above string example, we continue with: |[ if (!collect_values[0].v_pointer) value->data[0].v_pointer = g_strdup (""); else if (collect_flags & G_VALUE_NOCOPY_CONTENTS) { value->data[0].v_pointer = collect_values[0].v_pointer; // keep a flag for the value_free() implementation to not free this string value->data[1].v_uint = G_VALUE_NOCOPY_CONTENTS; } else value->data[0].v_pointer = g_strdup (collect_values[0].v_pointer); return NULL; ]| It should be noted, that it is generally a bad idea to follow the #G_VALUE_NOCOPY_CONTENTS hint for reference counted types. Due to reentrancy requirements and reference count assertions performed by the #GSignal code, reference counts should always be incremented for reference counted contents stored in the value->data array. To deviate from our string example for a moment, and taking a look at an exemplary implementation for collect_value() of #GObject: |[ if (collect_values[0].v_pointer) { GObject *object = G_OBJECT (collect_values[0].v_pointer); // never honour G_VALUE_NOCOPY_CONTENTS for ref-counted types value->data[0].v_pointer = g_object_ref (object); return NULL; } else return g_strdup_printf ("Object passed as invalid NULL pointer"); } ]| The reference count for valid objects is always incremented, regardless of @collect_flags. For invalid objects, the example returns a newly allocated string without altering @value. Upon success, collect_value() needs to return %NULL. If, however, an error condition occurred, collect_value() may spew an error by returning a newly allocated non-%NULL string, giving a suitable description of the error condition. The calling code makes no assumptions about the @value contents being valid upon error returns, @value is simply thrown away without further freeing. As such, it is a good idea to not allocate #GValue contents, prior to returning an error, however, collect_values() is not obliged to return a correctly setup @value for error returns, simply because any non-%NULL return is considered a fatal condition so further program behaviour is undefined.
 * @lcopy_format: Format description of the arguments to collect for @lcopy_value, analogous to @collect_format. Usually, @lcopy_format string consists only of 'p's to provide lcopy_value() with pointers to storage locations.
 * @lcopy_value: This function is responsible for storing the @value contents into arguments passed through a variable argument list which got collected into @collect_values according to @lcopy_format. @n_collect_values equals the string length of @lcopy_format, and @collect_flags may contain %G_VALUE_NOCOPY_CONTENTS. In contrast to collect_value(), lcopy_value() is obliged to always properly support %G_VALUE_NOCOPY_CONTENTS. Similar to collect_value() the function may prematurely abort by returning a newly allocated string describing an error condition. To complete the string example: |[ gchar **string_p = collect_values[0].v_pointer; if (!string_p) return g_strdup_printf ("string location passed as NULL"); if (collect_flags & G_VALUE_NOCOPY_CONTENTS) *string_p = value->data[0].v_pointer; else *string_p = g_strdup (value->data[0].v_pointer); ]| And an illustrative version of lcopy_value() for reference-counted types: |[ GObject **object_p = collect_values[0].v_pointer; if (!object_p) return g_strdup_printf ("object location passed as NULL"); if (!value->data[0].v_pointer) *object_p = NULL; else if (collect_flags & G_VALUE_NOCOPY_CONTENTS) /&ast; always honour &ast;/ *object_p = value->data[0].v_pointer; else *object_p = g_object_ref (value->data[0].v_pointer); return NULL; ]|
 *
 * The #GTypeValueTable provides the functions required by the #GValue implementation,
 * to serve as a container for values of a type.

/**
 * SECTION:async_queues
 * @title: Asynchronous Queues
 * @short_description: asynchronous communication between threads
 *
 * Often you need to communicate between different threads. In general
 * it's safer not to do this by shared memory, but by explicit message
 * passing. These messages only make sense asynchronously for
 * multi-threaded applications though, as a synchronous operation could
 * as well be done in the same thread.
 *
 * Asynchronous queues are an exception from most other GLib data
 * structures, as they can be used simultaneously from multiple threads
 * without explicit locking and they bring their own builtin reference
 * counting. This is because the nature of an asynchronous queue is that
 * it will always be used by at least 2 concurrent threads.
 *
 * For using an asynchronous queue you first have to create one with
 * g_async_queue_new(). A newly-created queue will get the reference
 * count 1. Whenever another thread is creating a new reference of (that
 * is, pointer to) the queue, it has to increase the reference count
 * (using g_async_queue_ref()). Also, before removing this reference,
 * the reference count has to be decreased (using g_async_queue_unref()).
 * After that the queue might no longer exist so you must not access
 * it after that point.
 *
 * A thread, which wants to send a message to that queue simply calls
 * g_async_queue_push() to push the message to the queue.
 *
 * A thread, which is expecting messages from an asynchronous queue
 * simply calls g_async_queue_pop() for that queue. If no message is
 * available in the queue at that point, the thread is now put to sleep
 * until a message arrives. The message will be removed from the queue
 * and returned. The functions g_async_queue_try_pop() and
 * g_async_queue_timed_pop() can be used to only check for the presence
 * of messages or to only wait a certain time for messages respectively.
 *
 * For almost every function there exist two variants, one that locks
 * the queue and one that doesn't. That way you can hold the queue lock
 * (acquire it with g_async_queue_lock() and release it with
 * g_async_queue_unlock()) over multiple queue accessing instructions.
 * This can be necessary to ensure the integrity of the queue, but should
 * only be used when really necessary, as it can make your life harder
 * if used unwisely. Normally you should only use the locking function
 * variants (those without the suffix _unlocked)
 */


/**
 * SECTION:atomic_operations
 * @title: Atomic Operations
 * @short_description: basic atomic integer and pointer operations
 * @see_also: #GMutex
 *
 * The following is a collection of compiler macros to provide atomic
 * access to integer and pointer-sized values.
 *
 * The macros that have 'int' in the name will operate on pointers to
 * #gint and #guint.  The macros with 'pointer' in the name will operate
 * on pointers to any pointer-sized value, including #gsize.  There is
 * no support for 64bit operations on platforms with 32bit pointers
 * because it is not generally possible to perform these operations
 * atomically.
 *
 * The get, set and exchange operations for integers and pointers
 * nominally operate on #gint and #gpointer, respectively.  Of the
 * arithmetic operations, the 'add' operation operates on (and returns)
 * signed integer values (#gint and #gssize) and the 'and', 'or', and
 * 'xor' operations operate on (and return) unsigned integer values
 * (#guint and #gsize).
 *
 * All of the operations act as a full compiler and (where appropriate)
 * hardware memory barrier.  Acquire and release or producer and
 * consumer barrier semantics are not available through this API.
 *
 * On GCC, these macros are implemented using GCC intrinsic operations.
 * On non-GCC compilers they will evaluate to function calls to
 * functions implemented by GLib.
 *
 * If GLib itself was compiled with GCC then these functions will again
 * be implemented by the GCC intrinsics.  On Windows without GCC, the
 * interlocked API is used to implement the functions.
 *
 * With non-GCC compilers on non-Windows systems, the functions are
 * currently incapable of implementing true atomic operations --
 * instead, they fallback to holding a global lock while performing the
 * operation.  This provides atomicity between the threads of one
 * process, but not between separate processes.  For this reason, one
 * should exercise caution when attempting to use these options on
 * shared memory regions.
 *
 * It is very important that all accesses to a particular integer or
 * pointer be performed using only this API and that different sizes of
 * operation are not mixed or used on overlapping memory regions.  Never
 * read or assign directly from or to a value -- always use this API.
 *
 * For simple reference counting purposes you should use
 * g_atomic_int_inc() and g_atomic_int_dec_and_test().  Other uses that
 * fall outside of simple reference counting patterns are prone to
 * subtle bugs and occasionally undefined behaviour.  It is also worth
 * noting that since all of these operations require global
 * synchronisation of the entire machine, they can be quite slow.  In
 * the case of performing multiple atomic operations it can often be
 * faster to simply acquire a mutex lock around the critical area,
 * perform the operations normally and then release the lock.

 * the icon that should be used to represent the bookmark. The data is stored
 * using the
 * <ulink url="http://www.gnome.org/~ebassi/bookmark-spec">Desktop Bookmark
 * Specification</ulink>.
 *
 * The syntax of the bookmark files is described in detail inside the Desktop
 * Bookmark Specification, here is a quick summary: bookmark files use a
 * sub-class of the <ulink url="">XML Bookmark Exchange Language</ulink>
 * specification, consisting of valid UTF-8 encoded XML, under the
 * <literal>xbel</literal> root element; each bookmark is stored inside a
 * <literal>bookmark</literal> element, using its URI: no relative paths can
 * be used inside a bookmark file. The bookmark may have a user defined title
 * and description, to be used instead of the URI. Under the
 * <literal>metadata</literal> element, with its <literal>owner</literal>
 * attribute set to <literal>http://freedesktop.org</literal>, is stored the
 * meta-data about a resource pointed by its URI. The meta-data consists of
 * the resource's MIME type; the applications that have registered a bookmark;
 * the groups to which a bookmark belongs to; a visibility flag, used to set
 * the bookmark as "private" to the applications and groups that has it
 * registered; the URI and MIME type of an icon, to be used when displaying
 * the bookmark inside a GUI.

 *
 * A bookmark file might contain more than one bookmark; each bookmark
 * is accessed through its URI.
 *
 * The important caveat of bookmark files is that when you add a new
 * bookmark you must also add the application that is registering it, using
 * g_bookmark_file_add_application() or g_bookmark_file_set_app_info().
 * If a bookmark has no applications then it won't be dumped when creating

 * <title>File Name Encodings</title>
 * <para>
 * Historically, Unix has not had a defined encoding for file
 * names:  a file name is valid as long as it does not have path
 * separators in it ("/").  However, displaying file names may
 * require conversion:  from the character set in which they were
 * created, to the character set in which the application
 * operates.  Consider the Spanish file name
 * "<filename>Presentaci&oacute;n.sxi</filename>".  If the
 * application which created it uses ISO-8859-1 for its encoding,
 * </para>
 * <programlisting id="filename-iso8859-1">
 * Character:  P  r  e  s  e  n  t  a  c  i  &oacute;  n  .  s  x  i

 * </programlisting>
 * <para>
 * However, if the application use UTF-8, the actual file name on
 * disk would look like this:
 * </para>
 * <programlisting id="filename-utf-8">
 * Character:  P  r  e  s  e  n  t  a  c  i  &oacute;     n  .  s  x  i
 * Hex code:   50 72 65 73 65 6e 74 61 63 69 c3 b3 6e 2e 73 78 69
 * </programlisting>
 * <para>
 * Glib uses UTF-8 for its strings, and GUI toolkits like GTK+
 * that use Glib do the same thing.  If you get a file name from
 * the file system, for example, from readdir(3) or from g_dir_read_name(),
 * and you wish to display the file name to the user, you
 * <emphasis>will</emphasis> need to convert it into UTF-8.  The
 * opposite case is when the user types the name of a file he
 * wishes to save:  the toolkit will give you that string in
 * UTF-8 encoding, and you will need to convert it to the
 * character set used for file names before you can create the
 * file with open(2) or fopen(3).
 * </para>
 * <para>
 * By default, Glib assumes that file names on disk are in UTF-8
 * encoding.  This is a valid assumption for file systems which
 * were created relatively recently:  most applications use UTF-8
 * encoding for their strings, and that is also what they use for
 * the file names they create.  However, older file systems may
 * still contain file names created in "older" encodings, such as
 * ISO-8859-1. In this case, for compatibility reasons, you may
 * want to instruct Glib to use that particular encoding for file
 * names rather than UTF-8.  You can do this by specifying the
 * encoding for file names in the <link
 * linkend="G_FILENAME_ENCODING"><envar>G_FILENAME_ENCODING</envar></link>
 * environment variable.  For example, if your installation uses
 * ISO-8859-1 for file names, you can put this in your
 * <filename>~/.profile</filename>:
 * </para>
 * <programlisting>
 * export G_FILENAME_ENCODING=ISO-8859-1
 * </programlisting>
 * <para>
 * Glib provides the functions g_filename_to_utf8() and
 * g_filename_from_utf8() to perform the necessary conversions. These

 * There are two forms of most of the dataset functions. The first form
 * uses strings to identify the data elements associated with a
 * location. The second form uses #GQuark identifiers, which are
 * created with a call to g_quark_from_string() or
 * g_quark_from_static_string(). The second form is quicker, since it

 * #GDateTime is an immutable object; once it has been created it cannot
 * be modified further.  All modifiers will create a new #GDateTime.
 * Nearly all such functions can fail due to the date or time going out
 * of range, in which case %NULL will be returned.
 *
 * #GDateTime is reference counted: the reference count is increased by calling

/**
 * SECTION:error_reporting
 * @Title: Error Reporting
 * @Short_description: a system for reporting errors
 *
 * GLib provides a standard method of reporting errors from a called
 * function to the calling code. (This is the same problem solved by
 * exceptions in other languages.) It's important to understand that
 * this method is both a <emphasis>data type</emphasis> (the #GError
 * object) and a <emphasis>set of rules.</emphasis> If you use #GError
 * incorrectly, then your code will not properly interoperate with other
 * code that uses #GError, and users of your API will probably get confused.
 *
 * First and foremost: <emphasis>#GError should only be used to report
 * recoverable runtime errors, never to report programming
 * errors.</emphasis> If the programmer has screwed up, then you should
 * use g_warning(), g_return_if_fail(), g_assert(), g_error(), or some
 * similar facility. (Incidentally, remember that the g_error() function
 * should <emphasis>only</emphasis> be used for programming errors, it
 * should not be used to print any error reportable via #GError.)
 *
 * Examples of recoverable runtime errors are "file not found" or
 * "failed to parse input." Examples of programming errors are "NULL
 * passed to strcmp()" or "attempted to free the same pointer twice."
 * These two kinds of errors are fundamentally different: runtime errors
 * should be handled or reported to the user, programming errors should
 * be eliminated by fixing the bug in the program. This is why most
 * functions in GLib and GTK+ do not use the #GError facility.
 *
 * Functions that can fail take a return location for a #GError as their
 * last argument. For example:
 * |[
 * gboolean g_file_get_contents (const gchar  *filename,
 * gchar       **contents,
 * gsize        *length,
 * GError      **error);
 * ]|
 * If you pass a non-%NULL value for the <literal>error</literal>
 * argument, it should point to a location where an error can be placed.
 * For example:
 * |[
 * gchar *contents;
 * GError *err = NULL;
 * g_file_get_contents ("foo.txt", &amp;contents, NULL, &amp;err);
 * g_assert ((contents == NULL &amp;&amp; err != NULL) || (contents != NULL &amp;&amp; err == NULL));
 * if (err != NULL)
 * {
 * /&ast; Report error to user, and free error &ast;/
 * g_assert (contents == NULL);
 * fprintf (stderr, "Unable to read file: &percnt;s\n", err->message);
 * g_error_free (err);
 * }
 * else
 * {
 * /&ast; Use file contents &ast;/
 * g_assert (contents != NULL);
 * }
 * ]|
 * Note that <literal>err != NULL</literal> in this example is a
 * <emphasis>reliable</emphasis> indicator of whether
 * g_file_get_contents() failed. Additionally, g_file_get_contents()
 * returns a boolean which indicates whether it was successful.
 *
 * Because g_file_get_contents() returns %FALSE on failure, if you
 * are only interested in whether it failed and don't need to display
 * an error message, you can pass %NULL for the <literal>error</literal>
 * argument:
 * |[
 * if (g_file_get_contents ("foo.txt", &amp;contents, NULL, NULL)) /&ast; ignore errors &ast;/
 * /&ast; no error occurred &ast;/ ;
 * else
 * /&ast; error &ast;/ ;
 * ]|
 *
 * The #GError object contains three fields: <literal>domain</literal>
 * indicates the module the error-reporting function is located in,
 * <literal>code</literal> indicates the specific error that occurred,
 * and <literal>message</literal> is a user-readable error message with
 * as many details as possible. Several functions are provided to deal
 * with an error received from a called function: g_error_matches()
 * returns %TRUE if the error matches a given domain and code,
 * g_propagate_error() copies an error into an error location (so the
 * calling function will receive it), and g_clear_error() clears an
 * error location by freeing the error and resetting the location to
 * %NULL. To display an error to the user, simply display
 * <literal>error-&gt;message</literal>, perhaps along with additional
 * context known only to the calling function (the file being opened,
 * or whatever -- though in the g_file_get_contents() case,
 * <literal>error-&gt;message</literal> already contains a filename).
 *
 * When implementing a function that can report errors, the basic
 * tool is g_set_error(). Typically, if a fatal error occurs you
 * want to g_set_error(), then return immediately. g_set_error()
 * does nothing if the error location passed to it is %NULL.
 * Here's an example:
 * |[
 * gint
 * foo_open_file (GError **error)
 * {
 * gint fd;
 *
 * fd = open ("file.txt", O_RDONLY);
 *
 * if (fd &lt; 0)
 * {
 * g_set_error (error,
 * FOO_ERROR,                 /&ast; error domain &ast;/
 * FOO_ERROR_BLAH,            /&ast; error code &ast;/
 * "Failed to open file: &percnt;s", /&ast; error message format string &ast;/
 * g_strerror (errno));
 * return -1;
 * }
 * else
 * return fd;
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * Things are somewhat more complicated if you yourself call another
 * function that can report a #GError. If the sub-function indicates
 * fatal errors in some way other than reporting a #GError, such as
 * by returning %TRUE on success, you can simply do the following:
 * |[
 * gboolean
 * my_function_that_can_fail (GError **err)
 * {
 * g_return_val_if_fail (err == NULL || *err == NULL, FALSE);
 *
 * if (!sub_function_that_can_fail (err))
 * {
 * /&ast; assert that error was set by the sub-function &ast;/
 * g_assert (err == NULL || *err != NULL);
 * return FALSE;
 * }
 *
 * /&ast; otherwise continue, no error occurred &ast;/
 * g_assert (err == NULL || *err == NULL);
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * If the sub-function does not indicate errors other than by
 * reporting a #GError, you need to create a temporary #GError
 * since the passed-in one may be %NULL. g_propagate_error() is
 * intended for use in this case.
 * |[
 * gboolean
 * my_function_that_can_fail (GError **err)
 * {
 * GError *tmp_error;
 *
 * g_return_val_if_fail (err == NULL || *err == NULL, FALSE);
 *
 * tmp_error = NULL;
 * sub_function_that_can_fail (&amp;tmp_error);
 *
 * if (tmp_error != NULL)
 * {
 * /&ast; store tmp_error in err, if err != NULL,
 * &ast; otherwise call g_error_free() on tmp_error
 * &ast;/
 * g_propagate_error (err, tmp_error);
 * return FALSE;
 * }
 *
 * /&ast; otherwise continue, no error occurred &ast;/
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * Error pileups are always a bug. For example, this code is incorrect:
 * |[
 * gboolean
 * my_function_that_can_fail (GError **err)
 * {
 * GError *tmp_error;
 *
 * g_return_val_if_fail (err == NULL || *err == NULL, FALSE);
 *
 * tmp_error = NULL;
 * sub_function_that_can_fail (&amp;tmp_error);
 * other_function_that_can_fail (&amp;tmp_error);
 *
 * if (tmp_error != NULL)
 * {
 * g_propagate_error (err, tmp_error);
 * return FALSE;
 * }
 * }
 * ]|
 * <literal>tmp_error</literal> should be checked immediately after
 * sub_function_that_can_fail(), and either cleared or propagated
 * upward. The rule is: <emphasis>after each error, you must either
 * handle the error, or return it to the calling function</emphasis>.
 * Note that passing %NULL for the error location is the equivalent
 * of handling an error by always doing nothing about it. So the
 * following code is fine, assuming errors in sub_function_that_can_fail()
 * are not fatal to my_function_that_can_fail():
 * |[
 * gboolean
 * my_function_that_can_fail (GError **err)
 * {
 * GError *tmp_error;
 *
 * g_return_val_if_fail (err == NULL || *err == NULL, FALSE);
 *
 * sub_function_that_can_fail (NULL); /&ast; ignore errors &ast;/
 *
 * tmp_error = NULL;
 * other_function_that_can_fail (&amp;tmp_error);
 *
 * if (tmp_error != NULL)
 * {
 * g_propagate_error (err, tmp_error);
 * return FALSE;
 * }
 * }
 * ]|
 *
 * Note that passing %NULL for the error location
 * <emphasis>ignores</emphasis> errors; it's equivalent to
 * <literal>try { sub_function_that_can_fail (); } catch (...) {}</literal>
 * in C++. It does <emphasis>not</emphasis> mean to leave errors
 * unhandled; it means to handle them by doing nothing.
 *
 * Error domains and codes are conventionally named as follows:
 * <itemizedlist>
 * <listitem><para>

 * @see_also: <xref linkend="glib-regex-syntax"/>
 *
 * The <function>g_regex_*()</function> functions implement regular
 * expression pattern matching using syntax and semantics similar to
 * Perl regular expression.
 *
 * Some functions accept a @start_position argument, setting it differs
 * from just passing over a shortened string and setting #G_REGEX_MATCH_NOTBOL
 * in the case of a pattern that begins with any kind of lookbehind assertion.
 * For example, consider the pattern "\Biss\B" which finds occurrences of "iss"
 * in the middle of words. ("\B" matches only if the current position in the
 * subject is not a word boundary.) When applied to the string "Mississipi"
 * from the fourth byte, namely "issipi", it does not match, because "\B" is
 * always false at the start of the subject, which is deemed to be a word
 * boundary. However, if the entire string is passed , but with
 * @start_position set to 4, it finds the second occurrence of "iss" because
 * it is able to look behind the starting point to discover that it is
 * preceded by a letter.
 *
 * Note that, unless you set the #G_REGEX_RAW flag, all the strings passed
 * to these functions must be encoded in UTF-8. The lengths and the positions
 * inside the strings are in bytes and not in characters, so, for instance,
 * "\xc3\xa0" (i.e. "&agrave;") is two bytes long but it is treated as a
 * single character. If you set #G_REGEX_RAW the strings can be non-valid
 * UTF-8 strings and a byte is treated as a character, so "\xc3\xa0" is two
 * bytes and two characters long.
 *
 * When matching a pattern, "\n" matches only against a "\n" character in
 * the string, and "\r" matches only a "\r" character. To match any newline
 * sequence use "\R". This particular group matches either the two-character
 * sequence CR + LF ("\r\n"), or one of the single characters LF (linefeed,
 * U+000A, "\n"), VT vertical tab, U+000B, "\v"), FF (formfeed, U+000C, "\f"),
 * CR (carriage return, U+000D, "\r"), NEL (next line, U+0085), LS (line
 * separator, U+2028), or PS (paragraph separator, U+2029).
 *
 * The behaviour of the dot, circumflex, and dollar metacharacters are
 * affected by newline characters, the default is to recognize any newline
 * character (the same characters recognized by "\R"). This can be changed
 * with #G_REGEX_NEWLINE_CR, #G_REGEX_NEWLINE_LF and #G_REGEX_NEWLINE_CRLF
 * compile options, and with #G_REGEX_MATCH_NEWLINE_ANY,
 * #G_REGEX_MATCH_NEWLINE_CR, #G_REGEX_MATCH_NEWLINE_LF and
 * #G_REGEX_MATCH_NEWLINE_CRLF match options. These settings are also
 * relevant when compiling a pattern if #G_REGEX_EXTENDED is set, and an
 * unescaped "#" outside a character class is encountered. This indicates
 * a comment that lasts until after the next newline.
 *
 * Creating and manipulating the same #GRegex structure from different
 * threads is not a problem as #GRegex does not modify its internal
 * state between creation and destruction, on the other hand #GMatchInfo
 * is not threadsafe.

 * #GVariant is a variant datatype; it stores a value along with

 * values is determined by the type.  The type system used by #GVariant
 * is #GVariantType.
 *
 * #GVariant instances always have a type and a value (which are given
 * at construction time).  The type and value of a #GVariant instance
 * can never change other than by the #GVariant itself being
 * destroyed.  A #GVariant cannot contain a pointer.
 *
 * #GVariant is reference counted using g_variant_ref() and
 * g_variant_unref().  #GVariant also has floating reference counts --
 * see g_variant_ref_sink().
 *
 * #GVariant is completely threadsafe.  A #GVariant instance can be
 * concurrently accessed in any way from any number of threads without
 * problems.
 *
 * #GVariant is heavily optimised for dealing with data in serialised
 * form.  It works particularly well with data located in memory-mapped
 * files.  It can perform nearly all deserialisation operations in a
 * small constant time, usually touching only a single memory page.
 * Serialised #GVariant data can also be sent over the network.
 *
 * #GVariant is largely compatible with D-Bus.  Almost all types of
 * #GVariant instances can be sent over D-Bus.  See #GVariantType for
 * exceptions.
 *
 * For convenience to C programmers, #GVariant features powerful
 * varargs-based value construction and destruction.  This feature is

 * 32 and 64 bit integers and double precision floating point numbers
 * use their "natural" size.  Strings (including object path and
 * signature strings) are stored with a nul terminator, and as such
 * use the length of the string plus 1 byte.
 * </para>
 * <para>
 * Maybe types use no space at all to represent the null value and
 * use the same amount of space (sometimes plus one byte) as the
 * equivalent non-maybe-typed value to represent the non-null case.
 * </para>
 * <para>
 * Arrays use the amount of space required to store each of their
 * members, concatenated.  Additionally, if the items stored in an
 * array are not of a fixed-size (ie: strings, other arrays, etc)
 * then an additional framing offset is stored for each item.  The
 * size of this offset is either 1, 2 or 4 bytes depending on the
 * overall size of the container.  Additionally, extra padding bytes
 * are added as required for alignment of child values.
 * </para>
 * <para>
 * Tuples (including dictionary entries) use the amount of space
 * required to store each of their members, concatenated, plus one
 * framing offset (as per arrays) for each non-fixed-sized item in
 * the tuple, except for the last one.  Additionally, extra padding
 * bytes are added as required for alignment of child values.
 * </para>
 * <para>
 * Variants use the same amount of space as the item inside of the
 * variant, plus 1 byte, plus the length of the type string for the
 * item inside the variant.
 * </para>
 * <para>
 * As an example, consider a dictionary mapping strings to variants.
 * In the case that the dictionary is empty, 0 bytes are required for
 * the serialisation.
 * </para>
 * <para>
 * If we add an item "width" that maps to the int32 value of 500 then
 * we will use 4 byte to store the int32 (so 6 for the variant
 * containing it) and 6 bytes for the string.  The variant must be
 * aligned to 8 after the 6 bytes of the string, so that's 2 extra
 * bytes.  6 (string) + 2 (padding) + 6 (variant) is 14 bytes used
 * for the dictionary entry.  An additional 1 byte is added to the
 * array as a framing offset making a total of 15 bytes.
 * </para>
 * <para>
 * If we add another entry, "title" that maps to a nullable string
 * that happens to have a value of null, then we use 0 bytes for the
 * null value (and 3 bytes for the variant to contain it along with
 * its type string) plus 6 bytes for the string.  Again, we need 2
 * padding bytes.  That makes a total of 6 + 2 + 3 = 11 bytes.
 * </para>
 * <para>
 * We now require extra padding between the two items in the array.
 * After the 14 bytes of the first item, that's 2 bytes required.  We
 * now require 2 framing offsets for an extra two bytes.  14 + 2 + 11
 * + 2 = 29 bytes to encode the entire two-item dictionary.

 * <refsect3>
 * <title>Type Information Cache</title>
 * <para>
 * For each GVariant type that currently exists in the program a type
 * information structure is kept in the type information cache.  The
 * type information structure is required for rapid deserialisation.
 * </para>
 * <para>
 * Continuing with the above example, if a #GVariant exists with the
 * type "a{sv}" then a type information struct will exist for
 * "a{sv}", "{sv}", "s", and "v".  Multiple uses of the same type
 * will share the same type information.  Additionally, all
 * single-digit types are stored in read-only static memory and do
 * not contribute to the writable memory footprint of a program using
 * #GVariant.
 * </para>
 * <para>
 * Aside from the type information structures stored in read-only
 * memory, there are two forms of type information.  One is used for
 * container types where there is a single element type: arrays and
 * maybe types.  The other is used for container types where there
 * are multiple element types: tuples and dictionary entries.
 * </para>
 * <para>
 * Array type info structures are 6 * sizeof (void *), plus the
 * memory required to store the type string itself.  This means that
 * on 32bit systems, the cache entry for "a{sv}" would require 30
 * bytes of memory (plus malloc overhead).
 * </para>
 * <para>
 * Tuple type info structures are 6 * sizeof (void *), plus 4 *
 * sizeof (void *) for each item in the tuple, plus the memory
 * required to store the type string itself.  A 2-item tuple, for
 * example, would have a type information structure that consumed
 * writable memory in the size of 14 * sizeof (void *) (plus type
 * string)  This means that on 32bit systems, the cache entry for
 * "{sv}" would require 61 bytes of memory (plus malloc overhead).
 * </para>
 * <para>
 * This means that in total, for our "a{sv}" example, 91 bytes of
 * type information would be allocated.
 * </para>
 * <para>
 * The type information cache, additionally, uses a #GHashTable to
 * store and lookup the cached items and stores a pointer to this
 * hash table in static storage.  The hash table is freed when there
 * are zero items in the type cache.
 * </para>
 * <para>
 * Although these sizes may seem large it is important to remember
 * that a program will probably only have a very small number of
 * different types of values in it and that only one type information
 * structure is required for many different values of the same type.
 * </para>
 * </refsect3>
 * <refsect3>
 * <title>Buffer Management Memory</title>
 * <para>
 * #GVariant uses an internal buffer management structure to deal
 * with the various different possible sources of serialised data
 * that it uses.  The buffer is responsible for ensuring that the
 * correct call is made when the data is no longer in use by
 * #GVariant.  This may involve a g_free() or a g_slice_free() or
 * even g_mapped_file_unref().
 * </para>
 * <para>
 * One buffer management structure is used for each chunk of
 * serialised data.  The size of the buffer management structure is 4
 * * (void *).  On 32bit systems, that's 16 bytes.
 * </para>
 * </refsect3>
 * <refsect3>
 * <title>GVariant structure</title>
 * <para>
 * The size of a #GVariant structure is 6 * (void *).  On 32 bit
 * systems, that's 24 bytes.
 * </para>
 * <para>
 * #GVariant structures only exist if they are explicitly created
 * with API calls.  For example, if a #GVariant is constructed out of
 * serialised data for the example given above (with the dictionary)
 * then although there are 9 individual values that comprise the
 * entire dictionary (two keys, two values, two variants containing
 * the values, two dictionary entries, plus the dictionary itself),
 * only 1 #GVariant instance exists -- the one refering to the
 * dictionary.
 * </para>
 * <para>
 * If calls are made to start accessing the other values then
 * #GVariant instances will exist for those values only for as long
 * as they are in use (ie: until you call g_variant_unref()).  The
 * type information is shared.  The serialised data and the buffer
 * management structure for that serialised data is shared by the
 * child.
 * </para>
 * </refsect3>
 * <refsect3>
 * <title>Summary</title>
 * <para>
 * To put the entire example together, for our dictionary mapping
 * strings to variants (with two entries, as given above), we are
 * using 91 bytes of memory for type information, 29 byes of memory
 * for the serialised data, 16 bytes for buffer management and 24
 * bytes for the #GVariant instance, or a total of 160 bytes, plus
 * malloc overhead.  If we were to use g_variant_get_child_value() to
 * access the two dictionary entries, we would use an additional 48
 * bytes.  If we were to have other dictionaries of the same type, we
 * would use more memory for the serialised data and buffer
 * management for those dictionaries, but the type information would
 * be shared.

/**
 * SECTION:gvarianttype
 * @title: GVariantType
 * @short_description: introduction to the GVariant type system
 * @see_also: #GVariantType, #GVariant
 *
 * This section introduces the GVariant type system.  It is based, in
 * large part, on the D-Bus type system, with two major changes and some minor
 * lifting of restrictions.  The <ulink
 * url='http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html'>DBus
 * specification</ulink>, therefore, provides a significant amount of
 * information that is useful when working with GVariant.
 *
 * The first major change with respect to the D-Bus type system is the
 * introduction of maybe (or "nullable") types.  Any type in GVariant can be
 * converted to a maybe type, in which case, "nothing" (or "null") becomes a
 * valid value.  Maybe types have been added by introducing the
 * character "<literal>m</literal>" to type strings.
 *
 * The second major change is that the GVariant type system supports the
 * concept of "indefinite types" -- types that are less specific than
 * the normal types found in D-Bus.  For example, it is possible to speak
 * of "an array of any type" in GVariant, where the D-Bus type system
 * would require you to speak of "an array of integers" or "an array of
 * strings".  Indefinite types have been added by introducing the
 * characters "<literal>*</literal>", "<literal>?</literal>" and
 * "<literal>r</literal>" to type strings.
 *
 * Finally, all arbitrary restrictions relating to the complexity of
 * types are lifted along with the restriction that dictionary entries
 * may only appear nested inside of arrays.
 *
 * Just as in D-Bus, GVariant types are described with strings ("type
 * strings").  Subject to the differences mentioned above, these strings
 * are of the same form as those found in DBus.  Note, however: D-Bus
 * always works in terms of messages and therefore individual type
 * strings appear nowhere in its interface.  Instead, "signatures"
 * are a concatenation of the strings of the type of each argument in a
 * message.  GVariant deals with single values directly so GVariant type
 * strings always describe the type of exactly one value.  This means
 * that a D-Bus signature string is generally not a valid GVariant type
 * string -- except in the case that it is the signature of a message
 * containing exactly one argument.
 *
 * An indefinite type is similar in spirit to what may be called an
 * abstract type in other type systems.  No value can exist that has an
 * indefinite type as its type, but values can exist that have types
 * that are subtypes of indefinite types.  That is to say,
 * g_variant_get_type() will never return an indefinite type, but
 * calling g_variant_is_of_type() with an indefinite type may return
 * %TRUE.  For example, you cannot have a value that represents "an
 * array of no particular type", but you can have an "array of integers"
 * which certainly matches the type of "an array of no particular type",
 * since "array of integers" is a subtype of "array of no particular
 * type".
 *
 * This is similar to how instances of abstract classes may not
 * directly exist in other type systems, but instances of their
 * non-abstract subtypes may.  For example, in GTK, no object that has
 * the type of #GtkBin can exist (since #GtkBin is an abstract class),
 * but a #GtkWindow can certainly be instantiated, and you would say
 * that the #GtkWindow is a #GtkBin (since #GtkWindow is a subclass of
 * #GtkBin).
 *
 * A detailed description of GVariant type strings is given here:
 *

/**
 * SECTION:hash_tables
 * @title: Hash Tables
 * @short_description: associations between keys and values so that given a key the value can be found quickly
 *
 * A #GHashTable provides associations between keys and values which is
 * optimized so that given a key, the associated value can be found
 * very quickly.
 *
 * Note that neither keys nor values are copied when inserted into the
 * #GHashTable, so they must exist for the lifetime of the #GHashTable.
 * This means that the use of static strings is OK, but temporary
 * strings (i.e. those created in buffers and those returned by GTK+
 * widgets) should be copied with g_strdup() before being inserted.
 *
 * If keys or values are dynamically allocated, you must be careful to
 * ensure that they are freed when they are removed from the
 * #GHashTable, and also when they are overwritten by new insertions
 * into the #GHashTable. It is also not advisable to mix static strings
 * and dynamically-allocated strings in a #GHashTable, because it then
 * becomes difficult to determine whether the string should be freed.
 *
 * To create a #GHashTable, use g_hash_table_new().
 *
 * To insert a key and value into a #GHashTable, use
 * g_hash_table_insert().
 *
 * To lookup a value corresponding to a given key, use
 * g_hash_table_lookup() and g_hash_table_lookup_extended().
 *
 * g_hash_table_lookup_extended() can also be used to simply
 * check if a key is present in the hash table.
 *
 * To remove a key and value, use g_hash_table_remove().
 *
 * To call a function for each key and value pair use
 * g_hash_table_foreach() or use a iterator to iterate over the
 * key/value pairs in the hash table, see #GHashTableIter.
 *
 * To destroy a #GHashTable use g_hash_table_destroy().
 *
 * <example>
 * <title>Using a GHashTable as a set</title>
 * <para>
 * A common use-case for hash tables is to store information about
 * a set of keys, without associating any particular value with each
 * key. GHashTable optimizes one way of doing so: If you store only
 * key-value pairs where key == value, then GHashTable does not
 * allocate memory to store the values, which can be a considerable
 * space saving, if your set is large.

 * using file descriptors, pipes, and sockets, and integrating them
 * into the <link linkend="glib-The-Main-Event-Loop">main event
 * loop</link>. Currently full support is available on UNIX platforms,
 * support for Windows is only partially complete.
 *
 * To create a new #GIOChannel on UNIX systems use
 * g_io_channel_unix_new(). This works for plain file descriptors,
 * pipes and sockets. Alternatively, a channel can be created for a
 * file in a system independent manner using g_io_channel_new_file().
 *
 * Once a #GIOChannel has been created, it can be used in a generic
 * manner with the functions g_io_channel_read_chars(),
 * g_io_channel_write_chars(), g_io_channel_seek_position(), and
 * g_io_channel_shutdown().
 *
 * To add a #GIOChannel to the <link
 * linkend="glib-The-Main-Event-Loop">main event loop</link> use
 * g_io_add_watch() or g_io_add_watch_full(). Here you specify which
 * events you are interested in on the #GIOChannel, and provide a
 * function to be called whenever these events occur.
 *
 * #GIOChannel instances are created with an initial reference count of
 * 1. g_io_channel_ref() and g_io_channel_unref() can be used to
 * increment or decrement the reference count respectively. When the
 * reference count falls to 0, the #GIOChannel is freed. (Though it
 * isn't closed automatically, unless it was created using
 * g_io_channel_new_file().) Using g_io_add_watch() or
 * g_io_add_watch_full() increments a channel's reference count.
 *
 * The new functions g_io_channel_read_chars(),
 * g_io_channel_read_line(), g_io_channel_read_line_string(),
 * g_io_channel_read_to_end(), g_io_channel_write_chars(),
 * g_io_channel_seek_position(), and g_io_channel_flush() should not be
 * mixed with the deprecated functions g_io_channel_read(),
 * g_io_channel_write(), and g_io_channel_seek() on the same channel.

/**
 * SECTION:main
 * @title: The Main Event Loop
 * @short_description: manages all available sources of events
 *
 * The main event loop manages all the available sources of events for
 * GLib and GTK+ applications. These events can come from any number of
 * different types of sources such as file descriptors (plain files,
 * pipes or sockets) and timeouts. New types of event sources can also
 * be added using g_source_attach().
 *
 * To allow multiple independent sets of sources to be handled in
 * different threads, each source is associated with a #GMainContext.
 * A GMainContext can only be running in a single thread, but
 * sources can be added to it and removed from it from other threads.
 *
 * Each event source is assigned a priority. The default priority,
 * #G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, is 0. Values less than 0 denote higher priorities.
 * Values greater than 0 denote lower priorities. Events from high priority
 * sources are always processed before events from lower priority sources.
 *
 * Idle functions can also be added, and assigned a priority. These will
 * be run whenever no events with a higher priority are ready to be processed.
 *
 * The #GMainLoop data type represents a main event loop. A GMainLoop is
 * created with g_main_loop_new(). After adding the initial event sources,
 * g_main_loop_run() is called. This continuously checks for new events from
 * each of the event sources and dispatches them. Finally, the processing of
 * an event from one of the sources leads to a call to g_main_loop_quit() to
 * exit the main loop, and g_main_loop_run() returns.
 *
 * It is possible to create new instances of #GMainLoop recursively.
 * This is often used in GTK+ applications when showing modal dialog
 * boxes. Note that event sources are associated with a particular
 * #GMainContext, and will be checked and dispatched for all main
 * loops associated with that GMainContext.
 *
 * GTK+ contains wrappers of some of these functions, e.g. gtk_main(),
 * gtk_main_quit() and gtk_events_pending().
 *
 * <refsect2><title>Creating new source types</title>
 * <para>One of the unusual features of the #GMainLoop functionality
 * is that new types of event source can be created and used in
 * addition to the builtin type of event source. A new event source
 * type is used for handling GDK events. A new source type is created
 * by <firstterm>deriving</firstterm> from the #GSource structure.
 * The derived type of source is represented by a structure that has
 * the #GSource structure as a first element, and other elements specific
 * to the new source type. To create an instance of the new source type,
 * call g_source_new() passing in the size of the derived structure and
 * a table of functions. These #GSourceFuncs determine the behavior of
 * the new source type.</para>
 * <para>New source types basically interact with the main context
 * in two ways. Their prepare function in #GSourceFuncs can set a timeout
 * to determine the maximum amount of time that the main loop will sleep
 * before checking the source again. In addition, or as well, the source
 * can add file descriptors to the set that the main context checks using
 * g_source_add_poll().</para>
 * </refsect2>
 * <refsect2><title>Customizing the main loop iteration</title>
 * <para>Single iterations of a #GMainContext can be run with
 * g_main_context_iteration(). In some cases, more detailed control
 * of exactly how the details of the main loop work is desired, for
 * instance, when integrating the #GMainLoop with an external main loop.
 * In such cases, you can call the component functions of
 * g_main_context_iteration() directly. These functions are
 * g_main_context_prepare(), g_main_context_query(),
 * g_main_context_check() and g_main_context_dispatch().</para>

 *
 * The "GMarkup" parser is intended to parse a simple markup format

 * parser. It should not be used if you expect to interoperate with

 * Full-scale XML parsers should be able to parse the subset used by
 * GMarkup, so you can easily migrate to full-scale XML at a later
 * time if the need arises.
 *
 * GMarkup is not guaranteed to signal an error on all invalid XML;
 * the parser may accept documents that an XML parser would not.
 * However, XML documents which are not well-formed<footnote
 * id="wellformed">Being wellformed is a weaker condition than being
 * valid. See the <ulink url="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/">XML
 * specification</ulink> for definitions of these terms.</footnote>

 * @title: Memory Chunks
 * @short_description: deprecated way to allocate groups of equal-sized chunks of memory
 *
 * Memory chunks provide an space-efficient way to allocate equal-sized
 * pieces of memory, called atoms. However, due to the administrative
 * overhead (in particular for #G_ALLOC_AND_FREE, and when used from
 * multiple threads), they are in practise often slower than direct use
 * of g_malloc(). Therefore, memory chunks have been deprecated in
 * favor of the <link linkend="glib-Memory-Slices">slice
 * allocator</link>, which has been added in 2.10. All internal uses of
 * memory chunks in GLib have been converted to the
 * <literal>g_slice</literal> API.
 *
 * There are two types of memory chunks, #G_ALLOC_ONLY, and
 * #G_ALLOC_AND_FREE. <itemizedlist> <listitem><para> #G_ALLOC_ONLY
 * chunks only allow allocation of atoms. The atoms can never be freed
 * individually. The memory chunk can only be free in its entirety.
 * </para></listitem> <listitem><para> #G_ALLOC_AND_FREE chunks do
 * allow atoms to be freed individually. The disadvantage of this is
 * that the memory chunk has to keep track of which atoms have been
 * freed. This results in more memory being used and a slight
 * degradation in performance. </para></listitem> </itemizedlist>
 *
 * To create a memory chunk use g_mem_chunk_new() or the convenience
 * macro g_mem_chunk_create().
 *
 * To allocate a new atom use g_mem_chunk_alloc(),
 * g_mem_chunk_alloc0(), or the convenience macros g_chunk_new() or
 * g_chunk_new0().
 *
 * To free an atom use g_mem_chunk_free(), or the convenience macro
 * g_chunk_free(). (Atoms can only be freed if the memory chunk is
 * created with the type set to #G_ALLOC_AND_FREE.)
 *
 * To free any blocks of memory which are no longer being used, use
 * g_mem_chunk_clean(). To clean all memory chunks, use g_blow_chunks().
 *
 * To reset the memory chunk, freeing all of the atoms, use
 * g_mem_chunk_reset().
 *
 * To destroy a memory chunk, use g_mem_chunk_destroy().
 *
 * To help debug memory chunks, use g_mem_chunk_info() and

 * </para></listitem><listitem><para>
 * Options can have an extra argument, which can be a number, a string or
 * a filename. For long options, the extra argument can be appended with
 * an equals sign after the option name, which is useful if the extra
 * argument starts with a dash, which would otherwise cause it to be
 * interpreted as another option.
 * </para></listitem><listitem><para>
 * Non-option arguments are returned to the application as rest arguments.
 * </para></listitem><listitem><para>
 * An argument consisting solely of two dashes turns off further parsing,
 * any remaining arguments (even those starting with a dash) are returned
 * to the application as rest arguments.
 * </para></listitem></itemizedlist>
 *
 * Another important feature of GOption is that it can automatically
 * generate nicely formatted help output. Unless it is explicitly turned
 * off with g_option_context_set_help_enabled(), GOption will recognize
 * the <option>--help</option>, <option>-?</option>,
 * <option>--help-all</option> and
 * <option>--help-</option><replaceable>groupname</replaceable> options
 * (where <replaceable>groupname</replaceable> is the name of a
 * #GOptionGroup) and write a text similar to the one shown in the
 * following example to stdout.
 *
 * <informalexample><screen>
 * Usage:
 * testtreemodel [OPTION...] - test tree model performance
 *
 * Help Options:
 * -h, --help               Show help options
 * --help-all               Show all help options
 * --help-gtk               Show GTK+ Options

 * Application Options:
 * -r, --repeats=N          Average over N repetitions
 * -m, --max-size=M         Test up to 2^M items
 * --display=DISPLAY        X display to use
 * -v, --verbose            Be verbose
 * -b, --beep               Beep when done
 * --rand                   Randomize the data
 * </screen></informalexample>
 *
 * GOption groups options in #GOptionGroup<!-- -->s, which makes it easy to
 * incorporate options from multiple sources. The intended use for this is
 * to let applications collect option groups from the libraries it uses,
 * add them to their #GOptionContext, and parse all options by a single call
 * to g_option_context_parse(). See gtk_get_option_group() for an example.
 *
 * If an option is declared to be of type string or filename, GOption takes
 * care of converting it to the right encoding; strings are returned in
 * UTF-8, filenames are returned in the GLib filename encoding. Note that
 * this only works if setlocale() has been called before
 * g_option_context_parse().
 *
 * Here is a complete example of setting up GOption to parse the example
 * commandline above and produce the example help output.

 * http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt.html</ulink>.
 *
 * If you just need a random number, you simply call the
 * <function>g_random_*</function> functions, which will create a
 * globally used #GRand and use the according
 * <function>g_rand_*</function> functions internally. Whenever you
 * need a stream of reproducible random numbers, you better create a
 * #GRand yourself and use the <function>g_rand_*</function> functions
 * directly, which will also be slightly faster. Initializing a #GRand
 * with a certain seed will produce exactly the same series of random
 * numbers on all platforms. This can thus be used as a seed for e.g.
 * games.
 *
 * The <function>g_rand*_range</function> functions will return high
 * quality equally distributed random numbers, whereas for example the
 * <literal>(g_random_int()&percnt;max)</literal> approach often
 * doesn't yield equally distributed numbers.
 *
 * GLib changed the seeding algorithm for the pseudo-random number
 * generator Mersenne Twister, as used by
 * <structname>GRand</structname> and <structname>GRandom</structname>.
 * This was necessary, because some seeds would yield very bad
 * pseudo-random streams.  Also the pseudo-random integers generated by

 * equal distribution with the new version of GLib.

/**
 * SECTION:relations
 * @title: Relations and Tuples
 * @short_description: tables of data which can be indexed on any number of fields
 *
 * A #GRelation is a table of data which can be indexed on any number
 * of fields, rather like simple database tables. A #GRelation contains
 * a number of records, called tuples. Each record contains a number of
 * fields. Records are not ordered, so it is not possible to find the
 * record at a particular index.
 *
 * Note that #GRelation tables are currently limited to 2 fields.
 *
 * To create a GRelation, use g_relation_new().
 *
 * To specify which fields should be indexed, use g_relation_index().
 * Note that this must be called before any tuples are added to the
 * #GRelation.
 *
 * To add records to a #GRelation use g_relation_insert().
 *
 * To determine if a given record appears in a #GRelation, use
 * g_relation_exists(). Note that fields are compared directly, so
 * pointers must point to the exact same position (i.e. different
 * copies of the same string will not match.)
 *
 * To count the number of records which have a particular value in a
 * given field, use g_relation_count().
 *
 * To get all the records which have a particular value in a given
 * field, use g_relation_select(). To access fields of the resulting
 * records, use g_tuples_index(). To free the resulting records use
 * g_tuples_destroy().
 *
 * To delete all records which have a particular value in a given
 * field, use g_relation_delete().
 *
 * To destroy the #GRelation, use g_relation_destroy().
 *
 * To help debug #GRelation objects, use g_relation_print().
 *
 * GRelation has been marked as deprecated, since this API has never
 * been fully implemented, is not very actively maintained and rarely
 * used.

/**
 * SECTION:sequence
 * @title: Sequences
 * @short_description: scalable lists
 *
 * The #GSequence data structure has the API of a list, but is
 * implemented internally with a balanced binary tree. This means that
 * it is possible to maintain a sorted list of n elements in time O(n
 * log n). The data contained in each element can be either integer
 * values, by using of the <link
 * linkend="glib-Type-Conversion-Macros">Type Conversion Macros</link>,
 * or simply pointers to any type of data.
 *
 * A #GSequence is accessed through <firstterm>iterators</firstterm>,
 * represented by a #GSequenceIter. An iterator represents a position
 * between two elements of the sequence. For example, the
 * <firstterm>begin</firstterm> iterator represents the gap immediately
 * before the first element of the sequence, and the
 * <firstterm>end</firstterm> iterator represents the gap immediately
 * after the last element. In an empty sequence, the begin and end
 * iterators are the same.
 *
 * Some methods on #GSequence operate on ranges of items. For example
 * g_sequence_foreach_range() will call a user-specified function on
 * each element with the given range. The range is delimited by the
 * gaps represented by the passed-in iterators, so if you pass in the
 * begin and end iterators, the range in question is the entire
 * sequence.
 *
 * The function g_sequence_get() is used with an iterator to access the
 * element immediately following the gap that the iterator represents.
 * The iterator is said to <firstterm>point</firstterm> to that element.
 *
 * Iterators are stable across most operations on a #GSequence. For
 * example an iterator pointing to some element of a sequence will
 * continue to point to that element even after the sequence is sorted.
 * Even moving an element to another sequence using for example
 * g_sequence_move_range() will not invalidate the iterators pointing
 * to it. The only operation that will invalidate an iterator is when
 * the element it points to is removed from any sequence.

/**
 * SECTION:string_chunks
 * @title: String Chunks
 * @short_description: efficient storage of groups of strings
 *
 * String chunks are used to store groups of strings. Memory is
 * allocated in blocks, and as strings are added to the #GStringChunk
 * they are copied into the next free position in a block. When a block
 * is full a new block is allocated.
 *
 * When storing a large number of strings, string chunks are more
 * efficient than using g_strdup() since fewer calls to malloc() are
 * needed, and less memory is wasted in memory allocation overheads.
 *
 * By adding strings with g_string_chunk_insert_const() it is also
 * possible to remove duplicates.

 *
 * Sometimes you wish to asynchronously fork out the execution of work
 * and continue working in your own thread. If that will happen often,
 * the overhead of starting and destroying a thread each time might be
 * too high. In such cases reusing already started threads seems like a
 * good idea. And it indeed is, but implementing this can be tedious
 * and error-prone.
 *
 * Therefore GLib provides thread pools for your convenience. An added
 * advantage is, that the threads can be shared between the different
 * subsystems of your program, when they are using GLib.
 *
 * To create a new thread pool, you use g_thread_pool_new(). It is
 * destroyed by g_thread_pool_free().
 *
 * If you want to execute a certain task within a thread pool, you call
 * g_thread_pool_push().
 *
 * To get the current number of running threads you call
 * g_thread_pool_get_num_threads(). To get the number of still
 * unprocessed tasks you call g_thread_pool_unprocessed(). To control
 * the maximal number of threads for a thread pool, you use
 * g_thread_pool_get_max_threads() and g_thread_pool_set_max_threads().
 *
 * Finally you can control the number of unused threads, that are kept
 * alive by GLib for future use. The current number can be fetched with
 * g_thread_pool_get_num_unused_threads(). The maximal number can be
 * controlled by g_thread_pool_get_max_unused_threads() and
 * g_thread_pool_set_max_unused_threads(). All currently unused threads
 * can be stopped by calling g_thread_pool_stop_unused_threads().
 */


/**
 * SECTION:threads
 * @title: Threads
 * @short_description: thread abstraction; including threads, different mutexes, conditions and thread private data
 * @see_also: #GThreadPool, #GAsyncQueue
 *
 * Threads act almost like processes, but unlike processes all threads
 * of one process share the same memory. This is good, as it provides
 * easy communication between the involved threads via this shared
 * memory, and it is bad, because strange things (so called
 * "Heisenbugs") might happen if the program is not carefully designed.
 * In particular, due to the concurrent nature of threads, no
 * assumptions on the order of execution of code running in different
 * threads can be made, unless order is explicitly forced by the
 * programmer through synchronization primitives.
 *
 * The aim of the thread related functions in GLib is to provide a
 * portable means for writing multi-threaded software. There are
 * primitives for mutexes to protect the access to portions of memory
 * (#GMutex, #GStaticMutex, #G_LOCK_DEFINE, #GStaticRecMutex and
 * #GStaticRWLock). There is a facility to use individual bits for
 * locks (g_bit_lock()). There are primitives for condition variables to
 * allow synchronization of threads (#GCond).  There are primitives for
 * thread-private data - data that every thread has a private instance
 * of (#GPrivate, #GStaticPrivate). There are facilities for one-time
 * initialization (#GOnce, g_once_init_enter()). Last but definitely
 * not least there are primitives to portably create and manage
 * threads (#GThread).
 *
 * The threading system is initialized with g_thread_init(), which
 * takes an optional custom thread implementation or %NULL for the
 * default implementation. If you want to call g_thread_init() with a
 * non-%NULL argument this must be done before executing any other GLib
 * functions (except g_mem_set_vtable()). This is a requirement even if
 * no threads are in fact ever created by the process.
 *
 * Calling g_thread_init() with a %NULL argument is somewhat more
 * relaxed. You may call any other glib functions in the main thread
 * before g_thread_init() as long as g_thread_init() is not called from
 * a glib callback, or with any locks held. However, many libraries
 * above glib does not support late initialization of threads, so doing
 * this should be avoided if possible.
 *
 * Please note that since version 2.24 the GObject initialization
 * function g_type_init() initializes threads (with a %NULL argument),
 * so most applications, including those using Gtk+ will run with
 * threads enabled. If you want a special thread implementation, make
 * sure you call g_thread_init() before g_type_init() is called.
 *
 * After calling g_thread_init(), GLib is completely thread safe (all
 * global data is automatically locked), but individual data structure
 * instances are not automatically locked for performance reasons. So,
 * for example you must coordinate accesses to the same #GHashTable
 * from multiple threads.  The two notable exceptions from this rule
 * are #GMainLoop and #GAsyncQueue, which <emphasis>are</emphasis>
 * threadsafe and need no further application-level locking to be
 * accessed from multiple threads.
 *
 * To help debugging problems in multithreaded applications, GLib
 * supports error-checking mutexes that will give you helpful error
 * messages on common problems. To use error-checking mutexes, define
 * the symbol #G_ERRORCHECK_MUTEXES when compiling the application.

 *
 * A time zone contains a number of intervals.  Each interval has
 * an abbreviation to describe it, an offet to UTC and a flag indicating
 * if the daylight savings time is in effect during that interval.  A
 * time zone always has at least one interval -- interval 0.
 *
 * Every UTC time is contained within exactly one interval, but a given
 * local time may be contained within zero, one or two intervals (due to
 * incontinuities associated with daylight savings time).
 *
 * An interval may refer to a specific period of time (eg: the duration
 * of daylight savings time during 2010) or it may refer to many periods
 * of time that share the same properties (eg: all periods of daylight
 * savings time).  It is also possible (usually for political reasons)

/**
 * g_atexit:
 * @func: (scope async): the function to call on normal program termination.
 *
 * Specifies a function to be called at normal program termination.
 *
 * Since GLib 2.8.2, on Windows g_atexit() actually is a preprocessor
 * macro that maps to a call to the atexit() function in the C
 * library. This means that in case the code that calls g_atexit(),
 * i.e. atexit(), is in a DLL, the function will be called when the
 * DLL is detached from the program. This typically makes more sense
 * than that the function is called when the GLib DLL is detached,
 * which happened earlier when g_atexit() was a function in the GLib
 * DLL.
 *
 * The behaviour of atexit() in the context of dynamically loaded
 * modules is not formally specified and varies wildly.
 *
 * On POSIX systems, calling g_atexit() (or atexit()) in a dynamically
 * loaded module which is unloaded before the program terminates might
 * well cause a crash at program exit.
 *
 * Some POSIX systems implement atexit() like Windows, and have each
 * dynamically loaded module maintain an own atexit chain that is
 * called when the module is unloaded.
 *
 * On other POSIX systems, before a dynamically loaded module is
 * unloaded, the registered atexit functions (if any) residing in that
 * module are called, regardless where the code that registered them
 * resided. This is presumably the most robust approach.
 *
 * As can be seen from the above, for portability it's best to avoid
 * calling g_atexit() (or atexit()) except in the main executable of a

 * This function is a wrapper of dgettext() which does not translate
 * the message if the default domain as set with textdomain() has no
 * translations for the current locale.
 *
 * The advantage of using this function over dgettext() proper is that
 * libraries using this function (like GTK+) will not use translations
 * if the application using the library does not have translations for
 * the current locale.  This results in a consistent English-only
 * interface instead of one having partial translations.  For this
 * feature to work, the call to textdomain() and setlocale() should
 * precede any g_dgettext() invocations.  For GTK+, it means calling
 * textdomain() before gtk_init or its variants.
 *
 * This function disables translations if and only if upon its first
 * call all the following conditions hold:
 * <itemizedlist>
 * <listitem>@domain is not %NULL</listitem>
 * <listitem>textdomain() has been called to set a default text domain</listitem>
 * <listitem>there is no translations available for the default text domain
 * and the current locale</listitem>
 * <listitem>current locale is not "C" or any English locales (those
 * starting with "en_")</listitem>
 * </itemizedlist>
 *
 * Note that this behavior may not be desired for example if an application
 * has its untranslated messages in a language other than English.  In those
 * cases the application should call textdomain() after initializing GTK+.

 * Applications should normally not use this function directly,
 * but use the _() macro for translations.

 * This works from an application, however, if you want to do the same
 * thing from a library, it gets more difficult, since you no longer
 * control the main loop. You might think you can simply use an idle
 * function to make the call to free_allocated_memory(), but that
 * doesn't work, since the idle function could be called from a
 * recursive callback. This can be fixed by using g_main_depth()
 *
 * |[

 *
 * There is a temptation to use g_main_depth() to solve
 * problems with reentrancy. For instance, while waiting for data
 * to be received from the network in response to a menu item,
 * the menu item might be selected again. It might seem that
 * one could make the menu item's callback return immediately
 * and do nothing if g_main_depth() returns a value greater than 1.
 * However, this should be avoided since the user then sees selecting
 * the menu item do nothing. Furthermore, you'll find yourself adding
 * these checks all over your code, since there are doubtless many,
 * many things that the user could do. Instead, you can use the
 * following techniques:
 *
 * <orderedlist>
 * <listitem>
 * <para>
 * Use gtk_widget_set_sensitive() or modal dialogs to prevent
 * the user from interacting with elements while the main
 * loop is recursing.
 * </para>
 * </listitem>
 * <listitem>
 * <para>
 * Avoid main loop recursion in situations where you can't handle
 * arbitrary  callbacks. Instead, structure your code so that you
 * simply return to the main loop and then get called again when
 * there is more work to do.

 *
 * In order to allow this parser to be easily used as a subparser, the

 * "^\d?\d(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\d\d$".
 * If the application sees the user’s keystrokes one by one, and can
 * check that what has been typed so far is potentially valid, it is
 * able to raise an error as soon as a mistake is made.
 *
 * GRegex supports the concept of partial matching by means of the

 * the partial matching algorithm cannot be used with all patterns.
 * So repeated single characters such as "a{2,4}" and repeated single
 * meta-sequences such as "\d+" are not permitted if the maximum number
 * of occurrences is greater than one. Optional items such as "\d?"
 * (where the maximum is one) are permitted. Quantifiers with any values
 * are permitted after parentheses, so the invalid examples above can be
 * coded thus "(a){2,4}" and "(\d)+". If #G_REGEX_MATCH_PARTIAL is set

 * A wrapper for the POSIX open() function. The open() function is
 * used to convert a pathname into a file descriptor.
 *
 * On POSIX systems file descriptors are implemented by the operating
 * system. On Windows, it's the C library that implements open() and
 * file descriptors. The actual Win32 API for opening files is quite
 * different, see MSDN documentation for CreateFile(). The Win32 API
 * uses file handles, which are more randomish integers, not small
 * integers like file descriptors.
 *
 * Because file descriptors are specific to the C library on Windows,
 * the file descriptor returned by this function makes sense only to
 * functions in the same C library. Thus if the GLib-using code uses a
 * different C library than GLib does, the file descriptor returned by
 * this function cannot be passed to C library functions like write()
 * or read().
 *
 * See your C library manual for more details about open().
 *
 * return value can be used exactly like the return value from open().

 * Returns: a new file descriptor, or -1 if an error occurred. The

 *
 * Executes a child program asynchronously (your program will not
 * block waiting for the child to exit). The child program is
 * specified by the only argument that must be provided, @argv. @argv
 * should be a %NULL-terminated array of strings, to be passed as the
 * argument vector for the child. The first string in @argv is of
 * course the name of the program to execute. By default, the name of
 * the program must be a full path; the <envar>PATH</envar> shell variable
 * will only be searched if you pass the %G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH flag.
 *
 * On Windows, note that all the string or string vector arguments to
 * this function and the other g_spawn*() functions are in UTF-8, the
 * GLib file name encoding. Unicode characters that are not part of
 * the system codepage passed in these arguments will be correctly
 * available in the spawned program only if it uses wide character API
 * to retrieve its command line. For C programs built with Microsoft's
 * tools it is enough to make the program have a wmain() instead of
 * main(). wmain() has a wide character argument vector as parameter.
 *
 * At least currently, mingw doesn't support wmain(), so if you use
 * mingw to develop the spawned program, it will have to call the
 * undocumented function __wgetmainargs() to get the wide character
 * argument vector and environment. See gspawn-win32-helper.c in the
 * GLib sources or init.c in the mingw runtime sources for a prototype
 * for that function. Alternatively, you can retrieve the Win32 system
 * level wide character command line passed to the spawned program
 * using the GetCommandLineW() function.
 *
 * On Windows the low-level child process creation API
 * <function>CreateProcess()</function> doesn't use argument vectors,
 * but a command line. The C runtime library's
 * <function>spawn*()</function> family of functions (which
 * g_spawn_async_with_pipes() eventually calls) paste the argument
 * vector elements together into a command line, and the C runtime startup code
 * does a corresponding reconstruction of an argument vector from the
 * command line, to be passed to main(). Complications arise when you have
 * argument vector elements that contain spaces of double quotes. The
 * <function>spawn*()</function> functions don't do any quoting or
 * escaping, but on the other hand the startup code does do unquoting
 * and unescaping in order to enable receiving arguments with embedded
 * spaces or double quotes. To work around this asymmetry,
 * g_spawn_async_with_pipes() will do quoting and escaping on argument
 * vector elements that need it before calling the C runtime
 * spawn() function.
 *
 * The returned @child_pid on Windows is a handle to the child
 * process, not its identifier. Process handles and process
 * identifiers are different concepts on Windows.
 *
 * @envp is a %NULL-terminated array of strings, where each string
 * has the form <literal>KEY=VALUE</literal>. This will become
 * the child's environment. If @envp is %NULL, the child inherits its
 * parent's environment.
 *
 * @flags should be the bitwise OR of any flags you want to affect the
 * function's behaviour. The %G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD means that
 * the child will not automatically be reaped; you must use a
 * #GChildWatch source to be notified about the death of the child
 * process. Eventually you must call g_spawn_close_pid() on the
 * @child_pid, in order to free resources which may be associated
 * with the child process. (On Unix, using a #GChildWatch source is
 * equivalent to calling waitpid() or handling the %SIGCHLD signal
 * manually. On Windows, calling g_spawn_close_pid() is equivalent
 * to calling CloseHandle() on the process handle returned in
 * @child_pid).
 *
 * %G_SPAWN_LEAVE_DESCRIPTORS_OPEN means that the parent's open file
 * descriptors will be inherited by the child; otherwise all
 * descriptors except stdin/stdout/stderr will be closed before
 * calling exec() in the child. %G_SPAWN_SEARCH_PATH
 * means that <literal>argv[0]</literal> need not be an absolute path, it
 * will be looked for in the user's <envar>PATH</envar>.
 * %G_SPAWN_STDOUT_TO_DEV_NULL means that the child's standard output will
 * be discarded, instead of going to the same location as the parent's
 * standard output. If you use this flag, @standard_output must be %NULL.
 * %G_SPAWN_STDERR_TO_DEV_NULL means that the child's standard error
 * will be discarded, instead of going to the same location as the parent's
 * standard error. If you use this flag, @standard_error must be %NULL.
 * %G_SPAWN_CHILD_INHERITS_STDIN means that the child will inherit the parent's
 * standard input (by default, the child's standard input is attached to
 * /dev/null). If you use this flag, @standard_input must be %NULL.
 * %G_SPAWN_FILE_AND_ARGV_ZERO means that the first element of @argv is
 * the file to execute, while the remaining elements are the
 * actual argument vector to pass to the file. Normally
 * g_spawn_async_with_pipes() uses @argv[0] as the file to execute, and
 * passes all of @argv to the child.
 *
 * @child_setup and @user_data are a function and user data. On POSIX
 * platforms, the function is called in the child after GLib has
 * performed all the setup it plans to perform (including creating
 * pipes, closing file descriptors, etc.) but before calling
 * exec(). That is, @child_setup is called just
 * before calling exec() in the child. Obviously
 * actions taken in this function will only affect the child, not the
 * parent.
 *
 * On Windows, there is no separate fork() and exec()
 * functionality. Child processes are created and run with a single
 * API call, CreateProcess(). There is no sensible thing @child_setup
 * could be used for on Windows so it is ignored and not called.
 *
 * If non-%NULL, @child_pid will on Unix be filled with the child's
 * process ID. You can use the process ID to send signals to the
 * child, or to use g_child_watch_add() (or waitpid()) if you specified the
 * %G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD flag. On Windows, @child_pid will be
 * filled with a handle to the child process only if you specified the
 * %G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD flag. You can then access the child
 * process using the Win32 API, for example wait for its termination
 * with the <function>WaitFor*()</function> functions, or examine its
 * exit code with GetExitCodeProcess(). You should close the handle
 * with CloseHandle() or g_spawn_close_pid() when you no longer need it.
 *
 * If non-%NULL, the @standard_input, @standard_output, @standard_error
 * locations will be filled with file descriptors for writing to the child's
 * standard input or reading from its standard output or standard error.
 * The caller of g_spawn_async_with_pipes() must close these file descriptors
 * when they are no longer in use. If these parameters are %NULL, the corresponding
 * pipe won't be created.
 *
 * If @standard_input is NULL, the child's standard input is attached to
 * /dev/null unless %G_SPAWN_CHILD_INHERITS_STDIN is set.
 *
 * If @standard_error is NULL, the child's standard error goes to the same
 * location as the parent's standard error unless %G_SPAWN_STDERR_TO_DEV_NULL
 * is set.
 *
 * If @standard_output is NULL, the child's standard output goes to the same
 * location as the parent's standard output unless %G_SPAWN_STDOUT_TO_DEV_NULL
 * is set.
 *
 * @error can be %NULL to ignore errors, or non-%NULL to report errors.
 * If an error is set, the function returns %FALSE. Errors
 * are reported even if they occur in the child (for example if the
 * executable in <literal>argv[0]</literal> is not found). Typically
 * the <literal>message</literal> field of returned errors should be displayed
 * to users. Possible errors are those from the #G_SPAWN_ERROR domain.
 *
 * If an error occurs, @child_pid, @standard_input, @standard_output,
 * and @standard_error will not be filled with valid values.
 *
 * If @child_pid is not %NULL and an error does not occur then the returned
 * process reference must be closed using g_spawn_close_pid().

 * this function is helpful.
 *
 * The situation where this function is helpful is when creating an API
 * that allows the user to provide a callback function that returns a
 * #GVariant.  We certainly want to allow the user the flexibility to
 * return a non-floating reference from this callback (for the case
 * where the value that is being returned already exists).
 *
 * At the same time, the style of the #GVariant API makes it likely that
 * for newly-created #GVariant instances, the user can be saved some
 * typing if they are allowed to return a #GVariant with a floating
 * reference.
 *
 * Using this function on the return value of the user's callback allows
 * the user to do whichever is more convenient for them.  The caller
 * will alway receives exactly one full reference to the value: either
 * the one that was returned in the first place, or a floating reference
 * that has been converted to a full reference.
 *
 * This function has an odd interaction when combined with
 * g_variant_ref_sink() running at the same time in another thread on
 * the same #GVariant instance.  If g_variant_ref_sink() runs first then
 * the result will be that the floating reference is converted to a hard
 * reference.  If g_variant_take_ref() runs first then the result will
 * be that the floating reference is converted to a hard reference and
 * an additional reference on top of that one is added.  It is best to
 * avoid this situation.

 *
 * The use of @package is deprecated. You should always pass %NULL. A
 * warning is printed if non-NULL is passed as @package.
 *
 * The original intended use of @package was for a short identifier of
 * the package, typically the same identifier as used for
 * <literal>GETTEXT_PACKAGE</literal> in software configured using GNU
 * autotools. The function first looks in the Windows Registry for the
 * value <literal>&num;InstallationDirectory</literal> in the key
 * <literal>&num;HKLM\Software\@package</literal>, and if that value
 * exists and is a string, returns that.
 *
 * It is strongly recommended that packagers of GLib-using libraries
 * for Windows do not store installation paths in the Registry to be
 * used by this function as that interfers with having several
 * parallel installations of the library. Enabling multiple
 * installations of different versions of some GLib-using library, or
 * GLib itself, is desirable for various reasons.
 *
 * For this reason it is recommeded to always pass %NULL as
 * @package to this function, to avoid the temptation to use the
 * Registry. In version 2.20 of GLib the @package parameter
 * will be ignored and this function won't look in the Registry at all.
 *
 * If @package is %NULL, or the above value isn't found in the
 * Registry, but @dll_name is non-%NULL, it should name a DLL loaded
 * into the current process. Typically that would be the name of the
 * DLL calling this function, looking for its installation
 * directory. The function then asks Windows what directory that DLL
 * was loaded from. If that directory's last component is "bin" or
 * "lib", the parent directory is returned, otherwise the directory
 * itself. If that DLL isn't loaded, the function proceeds as if
 * @dll_name was %NULL.
 *
 * If both @package and @dll_name are %NULL, the directory from where
 * the main executable of the process was loaded is used instead in
 * the same way as above.

/**
 * g_win32_get_package_installation_directory_of_module:
 * @hmodule: The Win32 handle for a DLL loaded into the current process, or %NULL
 *
 * This function tries to determine the installation directory of a
 * software package based on the location of a DLL of the software
 * package.
 *
 * @hmodule should be the handle of a loaded DLL or %NULL. The
 * function looks up the directory that DLL was loaded from. If
 * @hmodule is NULL, the directory the main executable of the current
 * process is looked up. If that directory's last component is "bin"
 * or "lib", its parent directory is returned, otherwise the directory
 * itself.
 *
 * It thus makes sense to pass only the handle to a "public" DLL of a
 * software package to this function, as such DLLs typically are known
 * to be installed in a "bin" or occasionally "lib" subfolder of the
 * installation folder. DLLs that are of the dynamically loaded module
 * or plugin variety are often located in more private locations
 * deeper down in the tree, from which it is impossible for GLib to
 * deduce the root of the package installation.
 *
 * The typical use case for this function is to have a DllMain() that
 * saves the handle for the DLL. Then when code in the DLL needs to
 * construct names of files in the installation tree it calls this
 * function passing the DLL handle.
 *
 * the software package @hmodule is from. The string is in the GLib
