.SH NAME
g-ir-scanner \- extracting C metadata from sources and headers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B g-ir-scanner
[OPTION...] FILES...
.SH DESCRIPTION
g-ir-scanner is a tool which generates GIR XML files by parsing headers
and introspecting GObject based libraries.
It is usually invoked during the normal build step for a project and
the information is saved to disk and later installed so language bindings 
and other applications can use it.
Header files and source files are passed in arguments on the command line.
The suffix determines if it should be treated as source (.c) or header (.h),
currently only C based libraries are supported by the scanner.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \---help
Show help options
.TP
.B \---format=FORMAT
This parameters decides which the resulting format will be used.
The default value is gir.
.TP
.B \---include=NAME
Parses another metadata file. The format is determined by looking
at the file suffix. If a library depends on another the corresponding
metadata file should be included so references to external types are
correctly specified.
.TP
.B \-i, ---library=LIBRARY
Specifies a library that will be introspected. This means that the 
*_get_type() functions in it will be called for GObject data types.
The name of the library should not contain the leading lib prefix nor
the ending shared library suffix.
.TP
.B \-L, ---library-path=PATH
Include this directory when searching for a library.
This option can be specified multiple times to include more than one
directory to look for libraries in.
.TP
.B \-n, ---namspace=NAME
The namespace name. This name should be capitalized, eg the first letter
should be upper case. Examples: Gtk, Clutter, WebKit.
.TP
.B \, ---strip-prefix=PREFIX
If this option is specified a prefix will be stripped from all functions.
If not specified, the lower case version of the namespace will be used.
Eg, a strip prefix of 
.B g_
and a namespace set to
.B GLib
will export the function 
.B g_type_name
as 
.B GLib.type_name.
.TP
.B \, ---output=FILENAME
Name of the file to output. Normally namespace + format extension.
Eg, GLib.gir.
.TP
.B \, ---pkg=PACKAGE
List of pkg-config packages to get compiler and linker flags from.
This option can be specified multiple times to include flags from 
several pkg-config packages.
.TP
.B \---verbose                       
Be verbose, include some debugging information.
.TP
.B \---noclosure                       
Do not delete unknown types from the resulting format.
.TP
.B \---typelib-xml                       
Convert the resulting xml to only output the types relevant
to the typelib compiler.
