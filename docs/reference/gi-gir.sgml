  <para>
    This chapter describes the GIR XML markup format.
    are interested in the procedure which GTK+ follows to draw its
    widgets and windows, you should read this chapter; this will be
    useful to know if you decide to implement your own widgets.  This
    chapter will also clarify the reasons behind the ways certain
    things are done in GTK+; for example, why you cannot change the
    background color of all widgets with the same method.
