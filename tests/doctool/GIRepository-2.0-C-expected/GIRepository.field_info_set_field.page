<p>Writes a field identified by a <link xref="GFieldInfo">GFieldInfo</link> to a C structure or
union.  This only handles fields of simple C types. It will fail
for a field of a composite type like a nested structure or union
even if that is actually writable. Note also that that it will refuse
to write fields where memory management would by required. A field
with a type such as 'char *' must be set with a setter function.</p></page>
